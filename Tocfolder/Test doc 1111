 
## Overview[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Unity_(game_engine)&action=edit&section=1)] 
 Unity gives users the ability to create games in both [2D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2D_computer_graphics) and [3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics), and the engine offers a primary scripting API in [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)), for both the Unity editor in the form of plugins, and games themselves, as well as [drag and drop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_and_drop) functionality. Prior to C# being the primary programming language used for the engine, it previously supported [Boo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boo_(programming_language)), which was removed in the Unity 5[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(game_engine)#cite_note-7) release, and a version of [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)called *UnityScript*, which was deprecated in August 2017 after the release of Unity 2017.1 in favor of C#.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(game_engine)#cite_note-8) 
 The engine has support for the following [graphics APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_API): [Direct3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct3D) on Windows and Xbox One; [OpenGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL) on Linux, macOS, and Windows; [OpenGL ES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_ES) on Android and iOS; [WebGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL) on the web; and proprietary APIs on the [video game consoles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console). Additionally, Unity supports the low-level APIs [Metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_(API)) on iOS and macOS and [Vulkan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulkan_(API)) on Android, Linux, and Windows, as well as [Direct3D 12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct3D_12) on Windows and Xbox One. 
 Within 2D games, Unity allows importation of sprites and an advanced 2D world renderer. For 3D games, Unity allows specification of [texture compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_compression), [mipmaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mipmap), and resolution settings for each platform that the game engine supports,[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(game_engine)#cite_note-Unity_Multiplatform-5) and provides support for [bump mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bump_mapping), [reflection mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_mapping), [parallax mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax_mapping), [screen space ambient occlusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_space_ambient_occlusion) (SSAO), dynamic shadows using [shadow maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_map), [render-to-texture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Render_to_Texture) and full-screen post-processing effects.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(game_engine)#cite_note-Unity_4_DirectX11-9) Unity also offers services to developers, these are: Unity Ads, Unity Analytics, Unity Certification, Unity Cloud Build, Unity Everyplay, Unity IAP, Unity Multiplayer, Unity Performance Reporting, Unity Collaborate and Unity Hub. 
 Unity supports the creation of custom vertexes, fragments (or pixels), tessellation, compute [shaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shader) and Unity's own surface shaders using [Cg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cg_(programming_language)), a modified version of Microsoft's [High-Level Shading Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Level_Shading_Language) developed by [Nvidia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia). 
## Supported platforms[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Unity_(game_engine)&action=edit&section=2)] 
 The Unity editor is supported on [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows) and [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS), with a version of the editor available for the [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) platform, albeit in an experimental stage,[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(game_engine)#cite_note-10) while the engine itself currently supports building games for 27 different platforms. The platforms are listed as the following: [iOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS), [Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)), [Tizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tizen), [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows), [Universal Windows Platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Windows_Platform), [Mac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS), [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux), [WebGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL), [PlayStation 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4), [PlayStation Vita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Vita), [Xbox One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One), [Wii U](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_U), [3DS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_3DS), [Oculus Rift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculus_Rift), [Google Cardboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cardboard), [SteamVR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_VR), [PlayStation VR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_VR), [Gear VR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Gear_VR), [Windows Mixed Reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Mixed_Reality), [Daydream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Daydream), [Android TV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_TV), [Samsung Smart TV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Electronics), [tvOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TvOS), [Nintendo Switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch), [Fire OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_OS), Facebook Gameroom, Apple's ARKit, Google's [ARCore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARCore), and [Vuforia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vuforia_Augmented_Reality_SDK). 
 Unity formerly supported seven other platforms including its own Unity Web Player. The Unity Web Player was a browser plugin that was only supported on Windows and macOS via [Chrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome), [Internet Explorer 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_11), and [Firefox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox),[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(game_engine)#cite_note-11) however it was deprecated in favor of [WebGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL).[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(game_engine)#cite_note-WPRoadmap-12) Since version 5, Unity has been offering its WebGL bundle compiled to JavaScript using a 2-stage language translator ([C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)) to [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) and finally to [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)).[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(game_engine)#cite_note-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(game_engine)#cite_note-14) 
 Unity is the default [software development kit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit) (SDK) used for Nintendo's [Wii U](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_U) [video game console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console), with a free copy included by Nintendo with each Wii U developer license. Unity Technologies calls this bundling of a third-party SDK an "industry first".[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(game_engine)#cite_note-VB_Unity_interview-15)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(game_engine)#cite_note-Unity_GamePad_at_Polygon-16) 
## Licensing model[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Unity_(game_engine)&action=edit&section=3)] 
 Unity has four licensing options, each with a varying degree of functionality. The plans are as follows: Personal, which supports all of the engine's core features except the dark skin UI in the engine's editor, and forces to have a splash screen embedded into games; Plus, which removes the splash screen restriction, increases the revenue capacity and total [concurrent users](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_user); Pro, which grants access to premium support, as well as performance reporting; and Enterprise, which grants access to Unity's source code, and offers a custom multiplayer solution. The rest of the differences are listed below.
